# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Acknowledgments
This capstone project has been an incredible journey of learning and growth. It allowed me to delve deeply into the MERN stack and explore the endless possibilities it offers for building full-stack applications. From creating dynamic, real-time features to integrating external APIs, this project provided a hands-on understanding of how to develop complex web applications.

One of the most valuable lessons Iâ€™ve learned is that the effort and time invested in skill development yield immeasurable returns. This experience has shown me that technical expertise not only strengthens problem-solving abilities but also opens doors to entrepreneurship. The knowledge gained here has equipped me with the confidence to create innovative solutions and consider building products that could impact real-world users.

The exploratory nature of this capstone has been especially rewarding. It demonstrated that development is not just about writing code but also about designing systems, thinking critically, and continuously learning. Every challenge faced during this journey has taught me resilience and the importance of persistence.

Finally, I want to acknowledge the mentors, peers, and learning resources that supported me throughout this process.  Tishana, Manara, Luis, Ray, Robert all of you that provided valuable time, and knowledge into my growth - I truly thank you.  Your guidance and feedback have been invaluable in pushing me to achieve more than I initially thought possible. This project stands as a testament to the fact that when you invest in yourself and embrace curiosity, you create opportunities for growth, innovation, and future success.
